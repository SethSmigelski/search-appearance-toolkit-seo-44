== Integrations & Advanced Analytics ==

The Search Appearance Toolkit serves as a hub for connecting your site to essential third-party services, helping you to create valuable analytics data and site insights.

= Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration =
Easily integrate with Google Tag Manager by pasting your `GTM-XXXXXXX` ID into the settings field. The plugin will correctly and safely inject the GTM scripts into your site's `<head>` and `<body>` on every page. No coding required.

= Sophisticated GTM Event Tracking =
With GTM enabled, you can check four boxes to start gathering important insights about site visitors: 

* **Rich SEO dataLayer:** Push foundational page data (like post category, author, tags, and page type) on every page load, allowing advanced users to create granular analytics triggers in GTM (e.g., "Fire this conversion pixel *only* on the 'Products' category").
* **Scroll Depth Tracking:** Find out how much of your content is being viewed by visitors. This feature pushes `scroll_depth` events as users scroll 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% down a page.
* **Outbound & Affiliate Link Click Tracking:** Measure when users click on links to leave your site, pushing an `external_link_click` event, conditionally identifying affiliate links (with `rel="sponsored"`) and pushing a separate `affiliate_link_click` event.
* **Jump Link Click Tracking:** Tracks engagement with your Jump Links Block by pushing a `jump_link_click` event, letting you see which sections your users are most interested in.

SEO 44's integration with Google Tag Manager pushes valuable events to the `dataLayer` for use in Google Analytics. The plugin provides an import file and detailed instructions for setting up Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics to receive event tracking data. 

= Webmaster Verification =
Verify your site with search engines quickly and easily. Paste your verification codes for **Google Search Console** and **Bing Webmaster Tools** into the corresponding fields in the Integrations tab. The plugin handles the rest, adding site verification meta tags to your website's head. No coding required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What SEO benefits can this plugin provide? =
Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) gives you control over the technical, on-page SEO factors that help search engines understand and rank your content. Key benefits include:
* **Optimized Snippets:** Control how your titles and descriptions appear in search results.
* **Rich Results:** The advanced Schema.org data helps you earn rich results like FAQs, How-Tos, and breadcrumbs in Google.
* **Crawlability:** A clean and comprehensive XML sitemap ensures search engines can find and index all of your important content and images.
* **User Engagement:** The Jump Links Block improves user experience, which is a positive ranking signal, and can help you earn "Jump to" links in search results.

= What SEO ranking factors can't this plugin control? =
While this plugin handles the crucial on-page technical SEO, it's important to remember that it cannot control other major ranking factors. These include factors such as the quality and originality of your content, your website's speed, mobile-friendliness, the number of quality backlinks pointing to your site, and your overall domain authority. 

Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) contains effective features for optimizing your content, providing the foundation for a comprehensive SEO strategy. SEO 44 tools, like the Jump Links Block and the scanner for FAQs and How-Tos, reward the creation of thoughtful and organized content. 

= How do I migrate from another SEO plugin? =
SEO 44 makes migration as simple as possible. Your previous SEO plugin saved the SEO data you created in your WordPress database. SEO 44 will find and use that data. 

Before migrating, please back up your WordPress database, including the postmeta table. Deactivate your previous SEO plugin while using SEO 44.

Go to the **Migration** tab of the SEO 44 settings page. There you will see three keys where SEO 44 will store and update your SEO titles, descriptions, and keywords. By default, these keys will be seo44_title, seo44_description, and seo44_keywords, but they can be updated to match the locations where your website already manages SEO information.

**One Click Migration**: The Migration tab includes a list of buttons with the names of popular SEO plugins. With one click, you can replace the seo44 keys with the standard meta keys for that other plugin.

Your old data won't be copied or duplicated; you will simply pick up right where you left off with your previous SEO plugin.

**Two-Click Migration**: If you'd like to verify which meta keys appear in your database, click the button to **Scan for SEO Meta Keys**

The scanner will display a list of potential matching meta keys and provide suggestions for matching title, description, and keyword keys. Click **Use Selected Keys and Save** to accept the suggestions, telling SEO 44 to use your existing meta keys.

You should now see your previous SEO titles and descriptions when you look at the SEO 44 metabox in your post editor.

= Does this plugin work with the block editor (Gutenberg)? =
Yes, the SEO 44 metabox appears and functions correctly with both the block editor and the classic editor. The advanced schema detection for FAQs and How-Tos works best with the block editor but has a fallback for the classic editor. The SEO 44 Jump Links Block is a custom block for use in the block editor.

= Which social media tags does this plugin use? =
SEO 44 helps your content look great when shared on social media platforms. You can enable the automatic generation of **Open Graph** (og:) tags, which Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest use, and **Twitter Card** meta tags for when your content appears on X (formerly Twitter). This ensures your posts have the correct title, description, and preview image when shared.

= How are social media images handled? =
The *featured image* of any post or page will automatically be used as the primary og:image and twitter:image tag. 

If you need a site-wide default image for pages that don't have a featured image, you can set a *Default Social Image* on the plugin's "Social Media" settings tab. This image will be used as a fallback social media image when a featured image has not been set.

= How can I see my webpage's schema? =
Your page's schema is added as a JSON-LD script in the <head> section of your page's HTML. To see it, go to a page on your website, right-click, and select "View Page Source." Search for the text application/ld+json to find the schema block. You can then copy the code and test it using a tool like the [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).

= How does the plugin handle author schema? =
SEO 44 creates a Person schema for the author of each article. To enhance this, it will automatically use the "Website" URL from the author's WordPress user profile to add url and @id attributes to the schema. This creates a powerful, machine-readable link between your content and its author, which helps search engines like Google build a stronger understanding of your site's authority and expertise (E-E-A-T).

= What are the benefits of using FAQPage and HowTo schema? =
The plugin intelligently scans your content for patterns that match question-and-answer formats or step-by-step instructions (when this option is enabled). The plugin locates this content and automatically generates FAQPage or HowTo schema that presents this content within the JSON-LD.

The benefit of this is that Google can use this structured data to display your content in special, highly visible formats in the search results. An FAQ page might appear as a rich snippet with expandable questions, while a How-To article can be featured in a step-by-step guide. Rich snippets make your search results stand out, which can significantly improve your click-through rate (CTR).

= Will this plugin create duplicate schema if my theme already adds them? =
No. The Schema Scanner will detect if your theme or another plugin is already outputting JSON-LD or Microdata. If it finds existing schema, it will notify you.  

= How do I add Google Tag Manager (GTM)? =
The Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) makes this easy. All you need is your Container ID. 
1.  In your Google Tag Manager account, find and copy your **Container** ID (it looks like `GTM-XXXXXXX`).
2.  In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Settings > SEO 44** and click the **"Integrations"** tab.
3.  Paste your Container ID into the **"Google Tag Manager ID"** field.
4.  Check the **"Enable Google Tag Manager"** box.
5.  Click **"Save Settings."**

That's it. The plugin will now automatically add both the required `<head>` script and `<body>` `<noscript>` tag to your entire site.

**New to Google Tag Manager?** When you create a new site in Google Tag Manager, you will receive instructions to (1) paste one block of code as high in the `<head>` of the page as possible and (2) paste another block of code immediately after the opening `<body>` tag. **You do not need to follow these instructions to add code manually.** The plugin handles this assignment for you. All you need to do is copy the GTM Container ID and paste it into the field in the integrations tab.  The plugin will do the rest!

= How do I set up Google Tag Manager (GTM) tracking for events (the easy way)? =

To save you time and eliminate errors, your plugin provides a "GTM Import File." This recipe contains all the tags, triggers, and variables necessary for GTM to listen for your plugin's custom events (like `jump_link_click` and `scroll_depth`) and send them to Google Analytics.

This setup is a two-part process. First, you'll configure GTM, then you'll configure Google Analytics.

**Part 1: Configure Google Tag Manager (GTM)**

1.  **In your WordPress admin,** go to **Settings > SEO 44 > Integrations**.
2.  Click the **"Download GTM Import File"** button to save the `seo44-gtm-recipe-importer.json` file. The download button is located below the field where you enter your Google Tag Manager ID.
3.  **In Google Tab Manager,** Open the GTM container for your website and go to **Admin > Import Container**.
4.  **Choose container file:** Upload the `seo44-gtm-recipe-importer.json` file.
5.  **Choose workspace:** Select your existing workspace.
6.  **Choose an import option (CRITICAL):**
    * Select the **"Merge"** option.
    * **NEVER** select "Overwrite," as this will delete all of your existing GTM tags.
7.  **Confirm Preview:** GTM will show you a preview of all the new tags, triggers, and variables. Click **Confirm.**
8.  Go to **Variables** and click on the **"GA4 - Measurement ID"** variable. 
9.  Replace the **`PASTE-YOUR-GA4-MEASUREMENT-ID-HERE`** placeholder with your own GA4 Measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXX`).
10. Finally, **Submit** and **Publish** your container.

**Part 2: Configure Google Analytics (GA4)**

With GTM now configured, you must next tell Google Analytics to "listen for" and "display" the custom data.

**Important:** You must manually register these new Custom Dimensions in GA4. If you skip this step, you will only see the count of the events, not the valuable data (like which link was clicked).

1.  Go to the **Admin** area in Google Analytics (by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left).
2.  In the "Property" column, find **Data display > Custom definitions**.
3.  Click the blue **"Create custom dimensions"** button.
4.  You will need to create **four** new dimensions, one by one.  Use the exact "Event parameter" names listed below.

**Dimension 1:**

* **Dimension name:** `click_text`
* **Scope:** `Event`
* **Event parameter:** `click_text`
* Click **Save.**
	
**Dimension 2:**

* **Dimension name:** `click_anchor`
* **Scope:** `Event`
* **Event parameter:** `click_anchor`
* Click **Save.**
	
**Dimension 3:**

* **Dimension name:** `scroll_percentage`
* **Scope:** `Event`
* **Event parameter:** `scroll_percentage`
* Click **Save.**
	
**Dimension 4:**

* **Dimension name:** `outbound_url`
* **Scope:** `Event`
* **Event parameter:** `outbound_url`
* Click **Save.**

After completing these steps (and waiting 24-48 hours for Google Analytics to process the data), you will be able to see all your new events and their associated data (like which links were clicked and how far users scrolled) in your Events report.

= How do I add my Google Search Console verification code? =

This plugin uses the "HTML tag" verification method, which is the most common and reliable way. All you need to do is copy the site verification code (just the code, not the full tag) provided by Google Search Console and paste it into the **"Google Search Console"** field on the **Settings > SEO 44 > Integrations** tab.

The [How to Set Up Site Verification Tags section of the SEO 44 Integrations Setup Guide](https://seo44plugin.com/search-appearance-toolkit-seo-44/integrations-setup-guide/#how-to-set-up-site-verification-tags) provides clear step-by-step instructions. 

= How do I add my Bing Webmaster Tools verification code? =

Similar to Google, Bing uses an "HTML meta tag" to verify your site. All you need to do is copy the site verification code (just the code, not the full tag) provided by Bing Webmaster Tools and paste it into the **"Bing Webmaster Tools"** field on the **Settings > SEO 44 > Integrations** tab.

The [How to Set Up Site Verification Tags section of the SEO 44 Integrations Setup Guide](https://seo44plugin.com/search-appearance-toolkit-seo-44/integrations-setup-guide/#how-to-set-up-site-verification-tags) provides clear step-by-step instructions. 

= Why can't I see the images in my sitemap? =
You can! The XML sitemap is a code file meant for search engines, so browsers don't display images directly. To verify that your images are included, go to your sitemap (e.g., yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml), right-click, and select "View Page Source." You will see the image URLs listed within <image:image> tags for each relevant post or page.

= My sitemap shows a "404 Not Found" error. How do I fix it? =
This can occur when WordPress has not yet recognized the new sitemap URL. To fix it, go to **Settings -> Permalinks** in your WordPress admin and click the "Save Changes" button. This will refresh your site's rewrite rules and make the sitemap visible. The sitemap generator also automatically disables the default WordPress sitemap. 

= How is the "Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44)" plugin different from the standalone "Jump Links Block (SEO 44)" plugin? =
The main **Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44)** plugin is a complete suite of tools that includes meta tag optimization, schema generation, XML sitemaps, *and* the Jump Links Block. The standalone **Jump Links Block (SEO 44)** plugin offers *only* the Jump Links Block functionality for users who don't need a full SEO suite. You only need one. If you are using the Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) plugin, you do not need the standalone block plugin.

= How can I save and reuse my custom styles for the Jump Links Block? =
You can save a fully customized Jump Links block as a Block Pattern to easily reuse it across your site. This is a handy WordPress feature. With Block Patterns, you don't have to repeat the process of manually setting the same style settings for Jump Links blocks on multiple pages. That work is done for you.

Follow these instructions to [create a Block Pattern of a Jump Links Block](https://seo44plugin.com/jump-links-block-seo-44/creating-block-patterns/).

== For Developers ==
For advanced theme development, SEO 44 provides four template tags for working with meta tags and schema structured data, as well as a filter hook for adding custom schema to sites.

== Credits ==

**WordPress.org:** The default placeholder favicon used in the "Search Results Snippet Preview" is based on the official WordPress logo. The image file is included locally within the plugin to comply with repository guidelines. 

== External Services ==

Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) utilizes a few external, third-party services in order to provide its full range of features. All of these features are optional.

= Google Tag Manager (GTM) Integration =

* **Service Description:** This plugin can automatically inject the Google Tag Manager (GTM) container script into your website's `<head>` and `<body>`. This allows you to manage all your third-party tracking scripts (like Google Analytics) from a single GTM dashboard.
* **Data Sent and Conditions:** This feature is **off by default**. If you enable the "Enable Google Tag Manager" option in the Integrations tab and provide your GTM Container ID (e.g., `GTM-XXXXXXX`), the plugin will add Google's official GTM script to every page of your site. This script will then download and run tracking code from Google's servers.
* **Service Provider Links:**
    * **Google:** [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

= Site Verification Tags (Google & Bing) =

* **Service Description:** To prove you own your site to search engines, this plugin allows you to add their required verification meta tags to your site's `<head>`.
* **Data Sent and Conditions:** This feature is **off by default**. It is only active if you paste a verification code into the "Google Search Console" or "Bing Webmaster Tools" fields in the Integrations tab. The plugin does not actively "send" this data; it simply adds a `<meta>` tag to your site's HTML, which Google's and Bing's crawlers will look for to verify your ownership.
* **Service Provider Links:**
    * **Google:** [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
    * **Bing (Microsoft):** [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/), [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

= Sitemap Ping Services (Google & Bing) =

* **Service Description:** To help your content get indexed faster, this plugin can automatically notify (or "ping") major search engines when your XML sitemap is updated. This feature uses the public ping services provided by Google and Bing.
* **Data Sent and Conditions:** This feature is **on by default** and can be disabled from the "XML Sitemaps" settings tab. If enabled, the plugin will send the URL of your website's sitemap (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml`) to Google and Bing. This happens automatically only when you publish a new post. No other data is sent.
* **Service Provider Links:**
    * **Google:** [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
