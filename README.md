## Frequently Asked Questions

### What SEO benefits can this plugin provide?
Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) gives you control over the technical, on-page SEO factors that help search engines understand and rank your content. Key benefits include:
* **Optimized Snippets:** Control how your titles and descriptions appear in search results.
* **Rich Results:** The advanced Schema.org data helps you earn rich results like FAQs, How-Tos, and breadcrumbs in Google.
* **Crawlability:** A clean and comprehensive XML sitemap ensures search engines can find and index all of your important content and images.
* **User Engagement:** The Jump Links Block improves user experience, which is a positive ranking signal, and can help you earn "Jump to" links in search results.

### What SEO ranking factors can't this plugin control?
While this plugin handles the crucial on-page technical SEO, it's important to remember that it cannot control other major ranking factors. These include factors such as the quality and originality of your content, your website's speed, mobile-friendliness, the number of quality backlinks pointing to your site, and your overall domain authority. 

Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) contains effective features for optimizing your content, providing the foundation for a comprehensive SEO strategy. SEO 44 tools, like the Jump Links Block and the scanner for FAQs and How-Tos, reward the creation of thoughtful and organized content. 

### How do I migrate from another SEO plugin?
SEO 44 makes migration as simple as possible. Your previous SEO plugin saved the SEO data you created in your WordPress database. SEO 44 will find and use that data. 

Before migrating, please back up your WordPress database, including the postmeta table. Deactivate your previous SEO plugin while using SEO 44.

Go to the **Migration** tab of the SEO 44 settings page. There you will see three keys where SEO 44 will store and update your SEO titles, descriptions, and keywords. By default, these keys will be seo44_title, seo44_description, and seo44_keywords, but they can be updated to match the locations where your website already manages SEO information.

**One Click Migration**: The Migration tab includes a list of buttons with the names of popular SEO plugins. With one click, you can replace the seo44 keys with the standard meta keys for that other plugin.

Your old data won't be copied or duplicated; you will simply pick up right where you left off with your previous SEO plugin.

**Two-Click Migration**: If you'd like to verify which meta keys appear in your database, click the button to **Scan for SEO Meta Keys**

The scanner will display a list of potential matching meta keys and provide suggestions for matching title, description, and keyword keys. Click **Use Selected Keys and Save** to accept the suggestions, telling SEO 44 to use your existing meta keys.

You should now see your previous SEO titles and descriptions when you look at the SEO 44 metabox in your post editor.

### Does this plugin work with the block editor (Gutenberg)?
Yes, the SEO 44 metabox appears and functions correctly with both the block editor and the classic editor. The advanced schema detection for FAQs and How-Tos works best with the block editor but has a fallback for the classic editor. The SEO 44 Jump Links Block is a custom block for use in the block editor.

### Which social media tags does this plugin use?
SEO 44 helps your content look great when shared on social media platforms. You can enable the automatic generation of **Open Graph** (og:) tags, which Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest use, and **Twitter Card** meta tags for when your content appears on X (formerly Twitter). This ensures your posts have the correct title, description, and preview image when shared.

### How are social media images handled?
The *featured image* of any post or page will automatically be used as the primary og:image and twitter:image tag. 

If you need a site-wide default image for pages that don't have a featured image, you can set a *Default Social Image* on the plugin's "Social Media" settings tab. This image will be used as a fallback social media image when a featured image has not been set.

### How can I see my webpage's schema?
Your page's schema is added as a JSON-LD script in the <head> section of your page's HTML. To see it, go to a page on your website, right-click, and select "View Page Source." Search for the text application/ld+json to find the schema block. You can then copy the code and test it using a tool like the [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/).

### How does the plugin handle author schema?
SEO 44 creates a Person schema for the author of each article. To enhance this, it will automatically use the "Website" URL from the author's WordPress user profile to add url and @id attributes to the schema. This creates a powerful, machine-readable link between your content and its author, which helps search engines like Google build a stronger understanding of your site's authority and expertise (E-E-A-T).

= What are the benefits of using FAQPage and HowTo schema? =
The plugin intelligently scans your content for patterns that match question-and-answer formats or step-by-step instructions (when this option is enabled). The plugin locates this content and automatically generates FAQPage or HowTo schema that presents this content within the JSON-LD.

The benefit of this is that Google can use this structured data to display your content in special, highly visible formats in the search results. An FAQ page might appear as a rich snippet with expandable questions, while a How-To article can be featured in a step-by-step guide. Rich snippets make your search results stand out, which can significantly improve your click-through rate (CTR).

### Will this plugin create duplicate schema if my theme already adds them?
No. The Schema Scanner will detect if your theme or another plugin is already outputting JSON-LD or Microdata. If it finds existing schema, it will notify you.  

### Why can't I see the images in my sitemap?
You can! The XML sitemap is a code file meant for search engines, so browsers don't display images directly. To verify that your images are included, go to your sitemap (e.g., yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml), right-click, and select "View Page Source." You will see the image URLs listed within <image:image> tags for each relevant post or page.

### My sitemap shows a "404 Not Found" error. How do I fix it?
This can occur when WordPress has not yet recognized the new sitemap URL. To fix it, go to **Settings -> Permalinks** in your WordPress admin and click the "Save Changes" button. This will refresh your site's rewrite rules and make the sitemap visible. The sitemap generator also automatically disables the default WordPress sitemap. 

###  Does SEO 44 offer template tags for theme developers?
Yes. For advanced theme development, SEO 44 provides four template tags that allow you to place the SEO and schema output in custom locations in your theme files.

* **get_the_seo44_tags():** This function **returns** the complete block of HTML meta tags as a PHP string.
* **the_seo44_tags():**  This function **prints** (echoes) the complete block of HTML meta tags, wrapped in wp_kses to ensure security.
* **get_the_seo44_schema():** This function **returns** the JSON-LD schema script tag as a PHP string.
* **the_seo44_schema():** This function **prints** (echoes) the JSON-LD schema script tag.

### How is the "Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44)" plugin different from the standalone "SEO 44 Jump Links Block" plugin?
The main **Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44)** plugin is a complete suite of tools that includes meta tag optimization, schema generation, XML sitemaps, *and* the Jump Links Block. The standalone **SEO 44 Jump Links Block** plugin offers *only* the Jump Links Block functionality for users who don't need a full SEO suite. You only need one—if you are using the SEO 44 plugin, you do not need the standalone block plugin.

---

## For Developers

SEO 44 is extensible and allows for the addition of custom schema types (like LocalBusiness or Product) via a WordPress filter hook.

### Adding Custom Schema with the 'seo44_add_schema_parts' Filter

The seo44_add_schema_parts filter allows for the injection of additional schema arrays into the final @graph output.

Example Usage:
The following example shows how you could create a small, separate plugin to add LocalBusiness schema to a specific "Contact Us" page.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Hooks into the 'seo44_add_schema_parts' filter to add custom schema.
 *
 * @param array $schema_parts The existing array of schema parts from SEO 44.
 * @param int   $post_id The ID of the current post being viewed.
 * @return array The modified array of schema parts.
 */
function my_custom_add_local_business_schema( $schema_parts, $post_id ) {
    // The ID of the "Contact Us" page.
    $contact_page_id = 123;

    // Only add this schema on our specific contact page.
    if ( $post_id == $contact_page_id ) {
        $local_business_schema = [
            '@context'    => 'https://schema.org',
            '@type'       => 'LocalBusiness',
            'name'        => 'SEO 44 Global Headquarters',
            'address'     => '123 Main St, Anytown, USA',
            'telephone'   => '555-555-1234'
        ];
        // Add our new schema to the array.
        $schema_parts[] = $local_business_schema;
    }
    // Always return the array.
    return $schema_parts;
}
add_filter( 'seo44_add_schema_parts', 'my_custom_add_local_business_schema', 10, 2 );
?>
```

##  External Services

Search Appearance Toolkit (SEO 44) utilizes a couple external, third-party services in order to provide its full range of features.

### Sitemap Ping Services (Google & Bing)

* **Service Description:** To help your content get indexed faster, this plugin can automatically notify (or "ping") major search engines when your XML sitemap is updated. This feature uses the public ping services provided by Google and Bing.
* **Data Sent and Conditions:** This feature is **off by default**. If you enable the "Ping Search Engines" option in the XML Sitemaps settings tab, the plugin will send the URL of your website's sitemap (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml`) to Google and Bing. This happens automatically only when you publish a new post. No other data is sent.
* **Service Provider Links:**
    * **Google:** [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
    * **Bing (Microsoft):** [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/), [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)
